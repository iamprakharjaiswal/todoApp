#### Todo App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

A simple todo-app made using react. Supports responsive desgin and uses React functional components with hooks.
The data is saved in a mongoDB database. Currently it doesn't support multi-user sessions so everyone gets the same
list of todos, something which will be improved in the coming days.

#### Technologies Used on Front End:
- ReactJS (Functional Components, hooks)
- Interacting with APIs (GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH)
- Responsive CSS 

#### Technologies Used on Back End:
- NodeJS (Express)
- MongoDB Atlas
